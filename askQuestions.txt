Hello!

I take the liberty to submit PR in this way. I like your software MKSH very much and have been using it for the past two years. 
This PR submission wants to ask why you haven't updated the new version in two years? And when will the next new version be released?

Once again, I apologize for this presumptuous interruption, look forward to your reply, and thank you again.
