# mksh
Fork of MirBSD Korn Shell Source Code.

This branch of the mksh, will primarily be enhenced in vi-editing environment.
I will try to get more and more things work, while still keeping the low resource usage.
My TODO list is mainly focused on edit.c, which includes:

1. vi-editing mode with ARROW keys etc.
2. tab-completion with extra configuration file.
