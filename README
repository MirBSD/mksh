This is the README for mirbsdksh, developed as part of the MirBSD
operating system at The MirOS Project, and produced portably.
Legal information is provided about a screenpage farther down.

To build mksh on MirOS, issue 'make obj && make depend && make'.

To build mksh on other operating systems, read Builsd.sh first
or consult http://wiki.mirbsd.de/MirbsdKsh for further infos.

Set the CC, CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment variables
to your likes. Don't complain if anything doesn't work.

Last updated Jul '99 for pdksh-5.2.14.
	(check ftp://ftp.cs.mun.ca:/pub/pdksh/ or
	 http://www.cs.mun.ca/~michael/pdksh/ for new versions/patches)

PD-ksh is a mostly complete AT&T ksh look-alike (see NOTES file for a list
of things not supported).  Work is mostly finished to make it fully
compatible with both POSIX and AT&T ksh (when the two don't conflict).

Since pdksh is free and compiles and runs on most common unix systems, it
is very useful in creating a consistent user interface across multiple
machines.  For example, in the CS dept. of MUN, pdksh is installed on a
variety of machines including Suns, HPs, DecStations, pcs running Linux,
etc., and is the login shell of ~5200 users.

If you would like to be notified via email of new releases as they become
available, send mail to pdksh-request@cs.mun.ca with subject
"send release notifications" (or "don't send release notifications" to stop
them).

Newer versions of pdksh may be available from
	ftp://ftp.cs.mun.ca:/pub/pdksh/
[...]

You can send bug reports, fixes, and enhancements to pdksh@cs.mun.ca (please
don't assume I will see bug reports that are posted to some newsgroup or
mailing list - I probably won't).
If you are reporting a bug (with or without a fix), please include
	* the version of pdksh you are using (see version.c, or, if you are
	  running pdksh, try echo $KSH_VERSION),
	* the machine, operating system and compiler you are using,
	* and a description of how to repeat the bug (a small shell
	  script that demonstrates the bug is best).
as well as the following, if relevant (if you aren't sure, include them)
	* what options you are using (both configure options and set -o options)
	* the output of configure, with the verbose flag
	  (eg, make distclean; ./configure --verbose)
	* the contents of config.log (this is created by the configure script)
	* if you are using gcc (the GNU C compiler), which version it is.

BTW, THE MOST FREQUENTLY REPORTED BUG IS
	echo hi | read a; echo $a	# Does not print hi
I'm aware of this and there is no need to report it.

Michael Rendell, michael@cs.mun.ca
